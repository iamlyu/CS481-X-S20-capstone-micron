## Submission

All files for this lab should be added to **this** directory. Remember that [30% of your grade](../../docs/syllabus.md#grading) is dependent on individual effort! So you **MUST** document what you worked on for this lab. If you spent the entire lab doing research then you must upload a summary of your research. Any work that is not documented by some sort of artifact (source code, documentation, etc.) will not be counted towards your final grade.

This lab is due on the date specified in the root level [README.md](../../README.md).
